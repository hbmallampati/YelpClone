# YelpClone

The Yelp Clone project aims to develop an application that extracts useful information from the Yelp dataset and provides a user-friendly interface for potential customers seeking businesses that match their search criteria. The application will allow users to search for businesses across various categories and sub-categories, using attributes associated with each category. Users will be able to view business reviews and information associated with each business category.

The primary feature of the application will be faceted search, which allows users to filter search results using available business attributes. Facets such as category, sub-category, attributes, reviews, stars, and votes will be available for users to filter search results. When a user clicks on a facet value, the search results will be reduced to only the items that have that value.
